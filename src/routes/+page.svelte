        I‚Äôm a <strong>product builder</strong> who bridges the gap between ambitious technical goals and real-world business needs. I thrive in roles that demand full ownership‚Äîfrom initial strategy and design to engineering execution and stakeholder management. I'm the person you bring in when you need to not only build a product right, but also build the right product.
        <br><br>
        Based in San Jose, CA, and ready to relocate for the right opportunity. Outside of work, you‚Äôll usually find me hitting the gym, playing chess, diving into a good non-fiction book, or reading up about the latest tech advancements on Twitter.
